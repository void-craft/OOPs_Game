# Adventure San Cris 🎮

Welcome to **Adventure San Cris**, a fun and interactive 2D game where you control a character to collect coins, avoid obstacles, and survive as long as possible! Built using JavaScript (ES6), HTML5, and CSS3, this project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, game mechanics, and sound management.

## Features ✨
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Move your character using keyboard controls to collect coins and avoid obstacles.
- **Score System:** Earn points by collecting coins and see your score update in real-time.
- **Lives System:** Start with 3 lives—lose them all, and it's game over!
- **Sound Effects:** Enjoy immersive background music and sound effects for actions like collecting coins or hitting obstacles.
- **Sound Controls:** Mute or adjust the volume of background music and sound effects using the in-game controls.
- **Start & Game Over Screens:** A welcoming start screen and a game over screen with your final stats.

## How to Play 🕹️
### Start the Game
Click the "Play" button on the start screen.

### Controls:
- Use the arrow keys or **WASD** to move your character.

### Objective:

### Game Over:
- The game ends when you lose all your lives or collect all the coins.
- Click "Restart" to play again.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
